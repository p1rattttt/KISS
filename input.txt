Good afternoon

Task No. 211

It is necessary to implement an effective search algorithm for a string in a very large text file. The file is uploaded once, then a large number of search requests occur.

The details of the implementation, architecture, optimization and the final type of solution depend entirely on you, we do not impose additional requirements.
However, all the aspects described above will be evaluated, so we expect high-quality implementation.
Please provide the solution with a clear description and documentation and (if necessary) a start-up/installation guide.
